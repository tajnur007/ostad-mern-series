# Project: Task Tracker

**Task Tracker** is a streamlined web application designed to enhance productivity and organization for both individual users and administrators. The user panel allows individuals to register, log in, and effortlessly manage their tasks by adding, editing, and marking them as complete. Users can also update their profiles for a personalized experience. On the admin side, an exclusive panel empowers administrators with the ability to oversee all tasks, assign priorities, and manage user accounts efficiently. With additional features such as email notifications, search functionality, and data visualization, Task Tracker ensures a comprehensive task management experience. Built with modern web technologies, this project is an excellent opportunity for users to master CRUD operations, authentication mechanisms, and gain hands-on experience in developing dynamic web applications.

## User Panel:

- Users can register and log in.
- Once logged in, users can add tasks, specifying a title, description, and due date.
- Users can view their own tasks, mark them as complete, and delete tasks.
- Users can update their profile (change password, update email, etc.).
  
## Admin Panel:

- Admins can log in with special admin credentials.
- Admins can view a list of all tasks created by all users.
- Admins can mark tasks as high priority or assign them to specific users.
- Admins can deactivate or suspend user accounts.
- Admins have access to a dashboard with statistics like the total number of tasks, completed tasks, etc.

## Additional features:

- Email notifications: Send automated email reminders to users for approaching task due dates.
- Search functionality: Allow users and admins to search for tasks based on keywords, due dates, or other criteria.
- User roles: Introduce different user roles (e.g., regular user, admin) with varying levels of access and permissions.
- Data visualization: Use charts or graphs to display task completion rates, user activity, or other relevant data.

## Technologies:

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React)
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js
- Database: MongoDB
- Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for user authentication

This project provides a good foundation for learning user authentication, CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, and the basics of building a web application with both user and admin functionalities.
